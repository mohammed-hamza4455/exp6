## AIM

To systematically address a UX problem (e.g., hospital appointment booking) by generating diverse design ideas, capturing user needs, modeling user interactions, and organizing content structure. This ensures the final product is user-centered, intuitive, and efficient.

## ALGORITHM 

1. **Problem Understanding:**  
   Identify the UX challenge and define user personas and goals.

2. **Ideation (Crazy 8s / Brainwriting):**  
   Generate multiple low-fidelity concepts rapidly to explore varied solutions.

3. **User Stories Creation:**  
   Translate personas and goals into structured user stories to clarify features and benefits.

4. **Scenario Development:**  
   Select key user stories and create narrative scenarios to understand context, emotions, and environment.

5. **Flow Diagram Construction:**  
   Map user/task flows with standard symbols (start, decision, action) to visualize steps and choices.

## RESULT

We generated many simple design ideas to explore different solutions. Clear user stories were created to capture what users want and why. User scenarios helped us understand how people interact with the app in real life. Flow diagrams showed the step-by-step process users follow to complete tasks. Card sorting was used to organize the app’s content logically, making navigation easier. Overall, these activities helped create a user-friendly and effective design.
